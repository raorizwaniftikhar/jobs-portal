<h4>ADVERTISING &amp; SCREENING CAMPAIGN</h4>
<p>As a result of our extensive marketing and advertising network, our website – <a href="http://www.jobs UAE-me.com/" target="_blank">www.jobs UAE-me.com</a> – receives from 6,000 to 8,500 visits per day from potential candidates across the globe. We also field a vast number of telephone calls and emails from applicants from countries all over the world. Our ability to generate so many leads is only matched by our ability to handle them all, and therefore we offer our clients two choices; branded or unbranded campaigns.</p>
<p>Branded campaigns feature your company&rsquo;s logo or corporate identity, and the responses can be dealt with by your internal resources, although many of our clients prefer us to screen the applicants on their behalf. Non branded campaigns are run under the jobs UAE banner ensuring that we handle the responses generated and you do not receive cold calls from interested applicants or sales people.</p>
<p>Whichever method you prefer, we are available to handle telephone and email responses, receive and sort resumes, and pre-interview candidates we feel may be appropriate for the position. All suitable resumes are sorted into three easily-to-handle groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Candidates most suited to your specifications</li>
  <li>Candidates who could be developed for each position</li>
  <li>Candidates not suitable for your current opening but who may be relevant for future use</li>
</ul>
<h4>WAGE &amp; COMPENSATION SURVEYS</h4>
<p>In order to attract and retain the best employees, it is essential that a company is able to offer a competitive salary that is in line with those of similar businesses. It all comes back to basic economics – if a company is paying under the going rate they will struggle to attract quality employees, resulting in a high staff turnover and the likely retention of only the underperforming employees. Conversely, paying over the going rate damages your business by denting profitability.</p>
<p>Our Wage and Compensation Survey is therefore extremely valuable as it allows you to determine fair yet competitive salaries suitable for each pay grade. We provide detailed comparisons of your industry&rsquo;s common compensation parameters, and package this together with comprehensive information about the market salaries for a range of given positions. On completion of the survey, we present you with a Wage and Compensation Analysis Report for all vacancies.</p>
<h4>PSYCHOMETRIC TESTING &amp; ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>The biggest concern an employer usually has is that their new employee must meet or exceed all of the academic requirements required for the position and possesses sufficient job-related experience. But with over 70% of the world&rsquo;s employers are now using aptitude tests as part of their recruitment process, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to consider an additional approach to your recruitment process?</p>
<p>jobs UAE has partnered with the Thomas International to provide Psychometric Testing and Analysis. The Thomas International system is based on theories of human behavioural characteristics and the Personal Profile Analysis (PPA) gives an insight into the subject&rsquo;s behavioural style at work along with assessments of their strengths, limitations and true potential. This is a validated, positive and non-critical behavioural analysis of a person in a work environment and provides a standardised method of comparing candidates against their peers.</p>
<h4>HR POLICIES &amp; PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>As a company grows it is important to define processes and put policies and procedures into a formalised system. At jobs UAE we can outline the requirements each business needs to adhere to in order to run a properly structured organisation which adheres to all local and regional employment legalities.</p>
<p>A standard HR Policy Manual would cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>General Definitions and Policies</li>
  <li>Employment Policies</li>
  <li>Human Resources Development Policies</li>
  <li>Employee Counselling and Progressive Discipline Policies</li>
  <li>Performance Appraisal and Job Evaluation</li>
  <li>Wage Compensation</li>
  <li>Benefits and Policies</li>
</ul>
<h4>WEB MARKETING</h4>
<p>Our far-reaching marketing and advertising campaigns generate from 6,000 to 8,500 visits per day to our websites, <a href="http://www.jobs UAE-me.com/" target="_blank">www.jobs UAE-me.com</a> and <a href="http://www.jobs UAEgulf.com/" target="_blank">www.jobs UAEgulf.com</a>. In addition to using our website to post details of the numerous positions we hold, we offer our clients an extremely economical solution to increase the visibility of their recruitment requirements. Branded Advertisements on our websites allow potential job seekers from any part of the world to be directed straight to your company for you to handle the recruitment process.</p>
