                  <strong>Is it required that I create an account in order to use this site?</strong><br>
                  No account is required to search for jobs, but in order to post resumes and cover letters and set up saved searches and job alerts; it is required to have an account.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>I forgot my password.  How do I login?</strong><br>
                  You will have to click on the &ldquo;Forgot your Password?&rdquo; link below the &ldquo;Already Registered?&rdquo; login box. This will prompt you to fill in the email address for the account.  An email will be sent to that address that will guide you through resetting your password. Note: the link to reset your password is only active for 24 hours.  If you don&rsquo;t update it within that time frame, you will need to have another email sent to you.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What if I have not received the email to reset my password?</strong><br>
                  Check your spam or junk email folder.  Your email provider may have regarded it as spam.  You should be able to indicate whether it is &ldquo;safe&rdquo; to receive emails from this site.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How do I change the email address associated to my account?</strong><br>
                  You can change the email associated to your account by logging into your account, and then, once logged in, clicking on the &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; link at the top of the page, where you see <br>
                  <br>
                  &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; or by clicking on the &ldquo;My Tools&rdquo; tab and going to &ldquo;Account Information.&rdquo; Once you change your email address, that new email address will be the one you will have to login with.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Can I use my Employer user name and password for my Seeker Account?</strong><br>
                  Yes, you can but it is not recommended.  If you are an employer and want to have a jobseeker account in order to understand the user experience, we recommend using a broad account like <a href="mailto:hr@company.com">hr@company.com</a> for the employer account and then using a personal work address like <a href="mailto:asimkr40@gmail.com">jsmith@company.com</a> for the jobseeker account. If you are a jobseeker, it is a best practice to not use your work email for a job search.</p>

                  You can contact us at  support <a href="mailto:support@gncareers.com">email</a>  here to have your account disabled. We do not delete accounts in case a user wants to reactivate their account.</p>
                <p><strong>Resume and Cover Letter Questions</strong><br>
                  <strong>How do I create and post a resume?</strong><br>
                  Once you have created an account you will be prompted to upload a resume.  You can skip this step, by just clicking on the continue button and come back to it later.  To create a resume after you have created the account, you have to click on the &ldquo;Resumes&rdquo; tab in the main navigation and select &ldquo;Create Resume&rdquo;.  Whether you are creating a resume as part of the account creation process or doing it later, you will be offered 4 different ways to get your resume in the system.<br>
                  1. Build Your Resume – Follow our easy step by step process to build a resume<br>
                  2. Cut and Paste – If you already have a resume you can copy and paste it into a form<br>
                  3. Upload your Resume – If you already have a resume you can upload it as an attachment<br>
                  4. Import Linkedin Profile<br>
                  We recommend that if you have a Linkedin Profile this is the best way to get your information uploaded.  You can modify your information once it has been input into your profile.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How many resumes and cover letters can I upload?</strong><br>
                  You can store up to 10 different resumes and 10 different cover letters.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Who will see my resume?</strong><br>
                  If you set your resume to &ldquo;Public&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; your resume will be searchable by employers.  Any employer whose jobs you have applied to, will be able to see your resume. However, if you have set your resume to &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo;, your contact details will be visible ONLY to Employers and Recruiters who have access to the resume database.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What is the use of setting my resume to private?</strong><br>
                  If you set your resume to &ldquo;Private&rdquo; your resume will not be available for viewing. This resume could be kept on record to be made active by you as and when required. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>I'm not looking for a job anymore. Should I cancel my account and remove my resumes?</strong><br>
                  We don&rsquo;t recommend that you cancel your account, but you can always remove your resumes or set them to private if you don&rsquo;t want to have them searchable.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What are Resume Views?</strong><br>
                  This indicates how many times your resume was viewed by an employer in the candidate database.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How can I increase my resume views?</strong><br>
                  Making sure that your profile and all of your work history and experience is filled out and as complete as possible will help improve the searchability of your resume.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What happens when I delete a resume?</strong><br>
                  It is removed from the site.  Once a resume is deleted it cannot be restored. <br>
                  Searching and Applying for Jobs</p>
                <p><strong>Job Search </strong><br>
                  <strong>How do I search for jobs on Site?</strong><br>
                  You can search for jobs from the search box at the top of any page using keywords and/or location and or job category.    To run a search, simply type keywords into the &ldquo;Keywords&rdquo; box describing the kind of job you want.  Note: you can indicate if you want the Keyword to only search on Job Titles.  You can also enter an Emirate or city in the '&rdquo;Location&rdquo; box and select a category/multiple categories to filter by. .  Then click the &ldquo;Search&rdquo; button or hit the Enter key on your keyboard.<br>
                  Take a look at our job search tips for more guidance, or try our advanced job search for additional options.</p>
                <p><strong>How can I get more relevant search results?</strong><br>
                  To get more relevant search results, you may want to fine tune your search using our advance search filters under the heading &ldquo;Refine Search&rdquo; on the left hand side of the search results page.  You can search by phrases, company, or category by clicking on &ldquo;Search Jobs&rdquo; in the main navigation bar and clicking on &ldquo;Advanced Search&rdquo; <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>My job search is returning too many jobs. What can I do?</strong><br>
                  Refine your search using the facet on the left of the search results. You can narrow by job title, location, job title, category, and company, and how recently it was posted. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How do I only see new jobs?</strong><br>
                  To see only new jobs, from the advance search form&rdquo;, you would scroll to the bottom of the page and select &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; under &ldquo;Display&rdquo;.<br>
                  You can also run a search and from the facet on the left column, narrow the results by selecting &ldquo;Posted Within&rdquo;.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How do I exclude Jobs from a specific company?</strong><br>
                  To exclude Jobs from a specific company, you will want to select &ldquo;Advance Search from tool bar &ldquo;Search Jobs&rdquo;.  You will find a search field, titled &ldquo;Exclude these words:&rdquo; You will have to put the company name in there.  However, just a note here - be careful if you are excluding words that may be a job requirement, i.e., must be Microsoft word proficient. If you are excluding &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo; you would not get any jobs that have the requirement in it.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What's the difference between Search and Browse for jobs?</strong><br>
                  Some jobseekers find it easier to scan all listings (browse) rather than run a specific search by company, category, location and job title (search).  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What do the numbers mean next to each Browse by section?</strong><br>
                  This indicates how many listings fall into each Browse category<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What is a job search Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed?</strong><br>
                  RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a way to subscribe to a website and have new content delivered to you. In order to use RSS, you need an RSS reader. Internet Explorer, Firefox, and other web browsers have RSS readers built-in. There are also online RSS and downloadable programs that you can use to view RSS feeds.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Saved Searches and Job Alerts</strong><br>
                  <strong>What is a Saved Search?</strong><br>
                  To save time, you can save your search and when you return to the site, login and run the search. You can specify to have a Saved Search sent to you as a &ldquo;JobAlert.&rdquo;<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How do I save a job search?</strong><br>
                  To save a search, you first need to search on the criteria you are interested in. Once you have run the search at the top of the search results page, there will be a button labeled &ldquo;Save Search.&rdquo; Once you have done that, you will be prompted to name your search.  At this point you can elect to have the search sent to you as a Job Alert, either daily or weekly. If you have not logged in yet, you will be prompted to login or create an account.</p>
                <p><strong>How do I stop my Job Alerts?</strong></p>
                <p>When you have logged in, you will have to go to the My Tools Tab dropdown and select &ldquo;Saved Searches.&rdquo;  This will take you to the &ldquo;My Saved Search Alerts&rdquo; page.  You will have to click on &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; and at this point you can edit the search by selecting &lsquo;edit search options&rsquo;.  You can set your alerts to &ldquo;never&rdquo;. You will stop receiving alerts. Under &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; you could also select the delete option to delete your saved search.</p>
                <p><strong>My alert is not giving me the jobs I want. How do I edit my Job Alert?<br>
                  </strong>Click on the "Edit Search Criteria&rdquo; within the Actions drop down.  This will take you to your saved search result page, where you can modify the search result using the facets on the left, or you can use &lsquo;modify search&rsquo; button.  In both cases, you will have to save the search again.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Why aren't I receiving my Job Alert emails?</strong><br>
                  Emails are only sent when jobs that match your search criteria are found.  Sometimes it may be that you need to expand the criteria of your search or it could just mean there are no jobs currently available that match your criteria.  We recommend running a search on the front end to verify that there are no jobs.  It also may be that your email is filtering on potential spam, so you may want to check your spam, junk or deleted folders.</p>

                <p><strong>Posting a Job</strong><br>
                  <strong>Do I need an account to Post a Job?</strong><br>
                  <strong>I posted a job for standard 30 day ad 5 days back and I want to do an upgrade, how much will I pay? And what will the expiry date of my ad change?<br>
                    <br>
                  </strong>Depending on which upgrade you select, you will pay only for the new upgrade under a new transaction. When you do an upgrade days after placing an ad or mid run, the duration or the expiry date will not change and will still be the same as of the original ad.<strong><br>
                      </strong><br>
                  <strong>Can I be invoiced for a job posting?</strong><br>
                  You will be able to purchase all of the job posting products by Credit Card. Please contact our sales department at<a href="mailto:info@gncareers.com">info@gncareers.com</a> if you are interested in job posting packages that support invoicing.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Do I need to fill in all of the information on the job postings?</strong><br>
                  Only fields that have the red asterix (*)next to them are required fields and need to be filled in. However we recommend that you fill in as much information as you can to improve the searchability of the job listing and attract the most qualified candidates.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Can I pick more than 1 category to associate my listings to?</strong><br>
                  Yes, you can select up to 5 categories.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What are descriptive keywords and how are they used?</strong><br>
                  Descriptive keywords are used when a matching upgrade is purchased for a job listing.  It helps insure that your search yields results with candidates are matching to your jobs.  You may want to use the same keywords from the job description, but you may also want to put some additional keywords for perhaps extra skills and knowledge you want this person to have.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What are the differences between the apply mechanisms?</strong><br>
                  • Applicants should apply online using the sites tools. In this instance the candidate can apply to a job with a resume stored in their account. You will receive notification of the application and it will also be stored in your account.<br>
                  • Applicants should apply at the URL provided below: Many employers have Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and want the resume sent directly to those systems.  There is usually a URL at the site associated to the listing which can be put in the field associated to this choice.<br>
                  • The applicants should apply using the instructions provided in the job description.  If you prefer that the jobseeker calls or comes to your location you may want to put this info in the job description.  We don&rsquo;t recommend this.  Even in the case of entry level or hourly works, most jobseekers are savvy enough to create their own resume.</p>
                <p><br>
                  <strong>What is an escreen questionnaire?</strong><br>
                  You may want to &ldquo;prequalify&rdquo; a candidate using questions to gauge their knowledge and experience related to the job they are applying for.  You can create a unique questionnaire for each job you post.  Once you have created a questionnaire you can save it for future postings.<br>
                  <br>
                  This escreen questionnaire will not be attached to your job posting unless you &ldquo;activate&rdquo; it. This can be activated after you have completed the transaction. For this you have to click &ldquo;Listings Manager. This will lead you to &ldquo;Job Manager&rdquo; page. Here you will see your posted job and once you click on the E-screen Interview Attached &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; button, you may be able to build your questionnaire.</p>
                <p><strong>I have filled the position and want to take it down, but still have days left.  Can I do that?</strong><br>
                  Yes you will have to go to &ldquo;Job Manager&rdquo; tab when you have logged in as an employer and select &ldquo;Manage posted jobs.&rdquo; This will give you a list of all &ldquo;active&rdquo; jobs by default. You can also search on previously posted but expired listings.  You will want to click on the &ldquo;RED X&rdquo; to delete the position.  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>I have not filled the position yet and it&rsquo;s about to expire, can I renew it? </strong> <br>
                  Yes, you will have to go to the &ldquo;Job Manager&rdquo; tab when you have logged in as an employer and select &ldquo;Manage Posted Jobs.&rdquo;  You will see a list of all active jobs.  You will have to click on the &ldquo;renew&rdquo; link.  The renew link will allow you to purchase another job posting or use inventory you may have available in a package. </p>
